        Agile Software Development is an iterative approach to project
        management and software development that helps teams deliver value to
        their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting
        everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small,
        but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are
        evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding
        to change quickly.
